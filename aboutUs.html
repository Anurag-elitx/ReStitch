            <br>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>At <strong>Restitch</strong>, our mission is to create a sustainable and compassionate world where every piece of clothing gets a second life and no person is left without the warmth and dignity they deserve. We connect the dots between generous donators who wish to give their old clothes a new purpose and those in need who can greatly benefit from them.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p><strong>Restitch</strong> is a bridge that links your wardrobe's past to someone's future. We collect gently used clothes from individuals and organizations. Our team then sorts, cleans, and repairs these items to ensure they are in top condition. These rejuvenated clothes are then distributed to shelters, low-income communities, and various humanitarian organizations, ensuring they reach the hands that need them most.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Our Impact</h3>
            <p>Since our inception, <strong>Restitch</strong> has distributed thousands of clothing items, impacting the lives of many. Each donation helps us reduce waste and support communities, promoting a cycle of generosity and sustainability.</p>
            <br>
